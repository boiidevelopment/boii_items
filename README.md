# BOII | Development - Items

# THIS IS STILL BEING WORKED ON AND WILL BE RELASED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

## üåç Overview

A comprehensive, mostly standalone item management resource.
This resource was created with the intention of filling the need for a shared item section within the BOII framework.
However as this resource relies on our curent boii_utils this can be used on any framework you require. 
The system includes a extensive item setup to allow for on use effects, from handling progress bars, modifying statuses, to applying buffs.
Also includeds a item drop system to allow players to drop synced item props for others to pick up.

Enjoy!
