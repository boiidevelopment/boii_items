# BOII | Development - Items

## üåç Overview

A comprehensive, mostly standalone item management resource. 
This resource was created with the intention of filling the need for a shared item section within the BOII framework. 

However as this resource relies on our current boii_utils this can be used on any framework you require. 

The system includes a extensive item setup to allow for on use effects, from handling progress bars, modifying statuses, to applying buffs. 

Also included is an item drop system to allow players to drop synced item props for others to pick up.
*(for inventories you will have to modify this yourself)*

Enjoy!

- **In-depth Item Setup:** Includes a in-depth setup for a variety of items.
